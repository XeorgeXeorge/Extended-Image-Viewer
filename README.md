# A work-in-progress, UWP image Viewer.

The repo will  follow a gradual, step by step update procedure with an emphasis on teaching the intregal designs and technical know-how 
that go into Image viewing and management in UWP.

There will be an end product at some point, something that could actually be used by normies but thats up to my time contraints
and community backing.



### Phase 1

The Initial Phase of this attemt goes through how to implement some basic view management operations on an image, it allows zooming even when the image is locked in the horizontal/vertical axis, it also introduces binding and DPs right off the bat so make sure you familiarize your self with those consepts before going deeper.


### Phase 2

*under work* Introduce a Control that will contain multiple images, something like a Flipview, it will allow for browing through images in an optimal way, it wont stick on one control tho, i'll try to emulate most popular Image viewing and browsing experiences, anything from an Comic Viewer to BingleDuck image results page will be implemented. albeit with a variable degree of success. 
 
### Phase 3

Phase 3 will go into the nitty gritty of Image data handling.
There will be stuff like Box selectors, cropping, drawing, resizing etc, believe me, they are a lot more simple than they sound.
It will also go through most of Imaging related entities in UWP, Bitmaps, Softwarebitmaps, BitmapSources, and many others, it will show how to interact from buffers, uris, files, rendered Xaml, Clipboard.... you name it.


### Phase 4 
Will be a conserned effort at trying to make an End-User app out of all this.
