# A work-in-progress, UWP image Viewer.

The repo will a follow a gradual, step by step update procedure with an emphasis on teaching the intregal designs and technical know=how 
that go into Image viewing and management in UWP.

There will be an end product at some point, something that could actually be used by normies but thats up to my time contraints
and community backing.



### Phase 1

The Initial Phase of this attemt goes through how to implement some basic view management on an image, it allows zooming even when the image is locked in the horizontal/vertical axis, it also introduces binding and DPs right off the boot so make sure you familiarize your self with those consepts before going deeper.


### Phase 2

(Todo) introduce a Control that will contain multiple images, something like Flipview, it will  allow for browing through images in an optimal way.
